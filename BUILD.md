# Building XNNPACK

This is a quick-start guide for building XNNPACK in some common configurations.
XNNPACK currently supports these build systems:

* [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

Some combinations of operating systems, compilers and CPU architectures are
tested regularly via GitHub Actions (see [build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml)).

## Building with CMake, testing with CTest

### Build without cross-compilation, default compiler
`scripts/build-local.sh` automatically configures and runs CMake for the host
CPU and operating system.

```sh
# In the XNNPACK root directory
scripts/build-local.sh
# Build artifacts will be created in build/local
cd build/local
# Run the test suite
ctest --output-on-failure --parallel $(nproc)
```

#### Specifying an alternate compiler
Standard CMake arguments like `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` and
`-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER` are used like this:

```sh
scripts/build-local.sh -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-19 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-19
cd build/local
ctest --output-on-failure --parallel $(nproc)
```

_Note_: `nproc` uses the number of CPU cores in your host system.

### Build for Android

* Building for Android requires setting the `ANDROID_NDK` environment variable.
* You can download the NDK [from here](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads).

```sh
# Set ANDROID_NDK to wherever the NDK is unpacked
export ANDROID_NDK=$HOME/bin/android-ndk-r27c
# Build for 32-bit Arm
./scripts/build-android-armv7.sh
# Push the compiled benchmarks onto an ADB-connected device
adb push ./build/android/armeabi-v7a/bench /data/local/tmp
```

### Combinations known to work
| Platform | Target     | Host CPU | Target CPU | Compiler           | Works  | Supported** | Notes  |
| -------- | -------    | -------- | ---------- |  ------------------|--------|-------------| -----  |
| Linux    | Linux      | x64      | x64        | Clang 19.1.7       | ✅     | ❌          | |
| Linux    | Linux      | x64      | x64        | GCC 14.2.0         | ✅     | ✅          | Various GCC versions are supported. |
| Linux    | Linux      | AArch64*  | Armv7-A   | GCC                | ✅     | ✅          | |
| MacOS    | MacOS      | AArch64  | AArch64    | GCC                | ✅     | ✅          | |
| Linux    | Android    | x64      | Armv7-A    | (NDK r27c provided)| ✅     | ✅          | |
| Linux    | Android    | x64      | AArch64    | (NDK r27c provided)| ✅     | ✅          | |
| Linux    | Android    | x64      | x64        | (NDK r27c provided)| ✅     | ✅          | |

(* Note: `AArch64` is the official name for the `arm64` CPU architecture).

(** Note: Supported combinations are regularly tested and should always work. If they don't, [raise a GitHub issue](https://github.com/google/XNNPACK/issues)).

## Building with Bazel

* Optional features are behind Bazel flags like
`--define=xnn_enable_avxvnni=false`.
* ⚠️ **Cross-compilation to another operating system (e.g. Android) or CPU
  architecture doesn't work on recent versions of Bazel**.
* Using Bazel's `:all` meta-target is not supported. Instead, use explicit
  targets like `//bench/...`.
* The `-c` parameter controls the optimization level:
   * `-c opt` enables `-O2`, with no assertions or debug information
     (recommended for production).
   * `-c fastbuild` means **no optimization**, minimal debug information, and
      assertions (for fast development and testing).
   * `-c dbg` means build with debug information enabled, **no optimization**
     (for debugging).

### Build benchmarks and test suites without cross-compilation, default compiler

```sh
bazel build -c fastbuild //bench/... //test/...
bazel test -c fastbuild --local_test_jobs=HOST_CPUS //bench/... //test/...
```

### Build benchmarks and test suites using an alternate compiler

Bazel listens to the `CC` and `CCX` environment variables, which specify
another compiler.

```sh
CC=clang-19 CXX=clang++-19 bazel build -c fastbuild //bench/... //test/...
CC=clang-19 CXX=clang++-19 bazel test -c fastbuild --local_test_jobs=HOST_CPUS //bench/... //test/...
```
