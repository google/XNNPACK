Description:
The Android NDK provides libraries and tools necessary for building, running,
and debugging C/C++ on Android. However, as Chromium builds it's own toolchain,
(and XNNPACK uses Chromium's toolchain in this instance)
this directory only contains the following artifacts from the NDK:

1. simpleperf
2. sysroot
3. lldb and lldb-server

Upgrading:
  * Update //DEPS with the latest instance ID from upstream Chromium
  * Update //DEPS with the latest `build` hash from upstream V8 DEPS
  * Update this README.xnnpack with the new version
